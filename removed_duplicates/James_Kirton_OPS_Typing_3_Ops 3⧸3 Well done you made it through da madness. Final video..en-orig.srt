them. Um so that was a big realization
 

15
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,509
them. Um so that was a big realization
of like, hey, what I'm offering versus

what I'm
receiving bipolar opposite, so why can't

20
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:27,279
receiving bipolar opposite, so why can't
 

21
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,550
receiving bipolar opposite, so why can't
I say no? And I'd say in a jerky way. I

22
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:30,560
I say no? And I'd say in a jerky way. I
 

23
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,150
I say no? And I'd say in a jerky way. I
started off saying like, "Oh, no." Like

24
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,160
started off saying like, "Oh, no." Like
 

25
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,190
started off saying like, "Oh, no." Like
in a silly American

26
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:34,200
in a silly American
 

27
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,270
in a silly American
accent.

28
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:36,280
accent.
 

29
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,069
accent.
Then sometimes I'd snap

30
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:39,079
Then sometimes I'd snap
 

31
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:41,150
Then sometimes I'd snap
though.

32
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:41,160
though.
 

33
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,869

37
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,310
just and I lost a few friendships from
that. that almost in itself it's like

38
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:48,320
that. that almost in itself it's like
 

39
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,069
that. that almost in itself it's like
either because it was too rapid of a a

40
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
either because it was too rapid of a a
 

41
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,950
either because it was too rapid of a a
change and like I was saying before

42
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:51,960
change and like I was saying before
 

43
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,549

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,350
infancy dependency that I was causing on
them by doing things for them or it was

46
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,360
them by doing things for them or it was
 

47
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,430
them by doing things for them or it was
because they just didn't value me that

48
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,440
because they just didn't value me that
 

49
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,670
because they just didn't value me that
much and but also I can't I've learned

50
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:01,680
much and but also I can't I've learned
 

51
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,390
much and but also I can't I've learned
that I can't defend or rely on other

52
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,400
that I can't defend or rely on other
 

53

56
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,240
know if the hat's making it hard to see
 

57
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,070
know if the hat's making it hard to see
imagine I do this like some [\h__\h]

58
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
imagine I do this like some [\h__\h]
 

59
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,590
imagine I do this like some [\h__\h]
weird American or something like what

60
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:11,600
weird American or something like what
 

61
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,109
weird American or something like what
the [\h__\h] no wait this is like

62
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:14,119
the [\h__\h] no wait this is like
 

63
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:16,789
the [\h__\h] no wait this is like
yo anyways but I was causing doing this

64
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
yo anyways but I was causing doing this
 

65
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,109
yo anyways but I was causing doing this
like um dependency thing, right? But

66
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,119
like um dependency thing, right? But
 

67
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,510
like um dependency thing, right? But
yeah, so I realized that my I can't

68
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:21,520
yeah, so I realized that my I can't
 

69
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,070

can't expect them to do that. Um yeah,
I've learned this. Um so by

74
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:29,439
I've learned this. Um so by
 

75
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,710
I've learned this. Um so by
selfrespecting or self-putting in

76
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:31,720
selfrespecting or self-putting in
 

77
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,830
selfrespecting or self-putting in
annoyances or instead of hinting like,

78
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
annoyances or instead of hinting like,
 

79
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,270
annoyances or instead of hinting like,
"Hey, I'm annoyed by this other people

80
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,280
"Hey, I'm annoyed by this other people
 

81
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,789
"Hey, I'm annoyed by this other people
got to step in cuz if they cared, they

82
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
got to step in cuz if they cared, they
 

83
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,990
got to step in cuz if they cared, they
would by selfdoing that um people can

84
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,000
would by selfdoing that um people can
 

85
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,390
would by selfdoing that um people can
recognize that." Now I tried this out. I

86
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:42,400
recognize that." Now I tried this out. I
 

87
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,069
recognize that." Now I tried this out. I
did this

88
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079
did this
 

89
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,069
did this
um and it just wasn't working. I was

90
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,079
um and it just wasn't working. I was
 

91
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,749
um and it just wasn't working. I was
like, wait, I was very pissed. I was

92
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:47,759
like, wait, I was very pissed. I was
 

93
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,109
like, wait, I was very pissed. I was
like, well, [\h__\h] them then. It didn't

94
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
like, well, [\h__\h] them then. It didn't
 

95
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,510
like, well, [\h__\h] them then. It didn't
work. I tried to do the fi I don't like

96
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
work. I tried to do the fi I don't like
 

97
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,109
work. I tried to do the fi I don't like
this. It's making me uncomfortable or

98
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,119
this. It's making me uncomfortable or
 

99
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,590
this. It's making me uncomfortable or
these jokes or these whatever. And it

100
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,600
these jokes or these whatever. And it
 

101
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,630
these jokes or these whatever. And it
wasn't working. So, I was like, well,

102
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
wasn't working. So, I was like, well,
 

103
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,830
wasn't working. So, I was like, well,
what the [\h__\h] the point? Like, this is

104
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:58,840
what the [\h__\h] the point? Like, this is
 

105
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,270
what the [\h__\h] the point? Like, this is
stupid. Um, I'll go back to slandering

106
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:02,280
stupid. Um, I'll go back to slandering
 

107
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,310
stupid. Um, I'll go back to slandering
them. But I learned that by consistency,

108
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
them. But I learned that by consistency,
 

109
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,830
them. But I learned that by consistency,
you can't build a character overnight.

110
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:07,840
you can't build a character overnight.
 

111
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,430
you can't build a character overnight.
You can't build selfrespect overnight.

112
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440
You can't build selfrespect overnight.
 

113
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,750
You can't build selfrespect overnight.
So by me consistently doing that I

114
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:11,760
So by me consistently doing that I
 

115
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,750
So by me consistently doing that I
noticed a change that other people

116
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760
noticed a change that other people
 

117
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,110
noticed a change that other people
started stepping in saying hey you know

118
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
started stepping in saying hey you know
 

119
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,949
started stepping in saying hey you know
you don't like that and it was working

389
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,469

Hi guys. Very scary warning flags in our

470
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
Hi guys. Very scary warning flags in our
 

471
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,910
Hi guys. Very scary warning flags in our
brain. Why do we have these warning

472
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,920
brain. Why do we have these warning
 

473
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,870
brain. Why do we have these warning
flags? evolutionary 30 to 40% of serial

474
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
flags? evolutionary 30 to 40% of serial
 

475
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,670

killers, murderers, dictators, rapists

476
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,680
killers, murderers, dictators, rapists
 

477
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,269
killers, murderers, dictators, rapists
do they smile in the pictures

478
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:36,279
do they smile in the pictures
 

479
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,310
do they smile in the pictures
unconsciously. And I think it's linked

480
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,320
unconsciously. And I think it's linked
 

481
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,990
unconsciously. And I think it's linked
to their thinking of things. So they're

482
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,000
to their thinking of things. So they're
 

483
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,190
to their thinking of things. So they're
like, "Oh, we're family." And then

484
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
like, "Oh, we're family." And then
 

485
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,430
like, "Oh, we're family." And then
they're getting shocked, generally

486
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440
they're getting shocked, generally
 

487
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,430
they're getting shocked, generally
aroused, terrified of their own thoughts

488
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:45,440
aroused, terrified of their own thoughts
 

489
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,550
aroused, terrified of their own thoughts
of what they were going to do. I feel

490
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:46,560
of what they were going to do. I feel
 

491
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,150
of what they were going to do. I feel
like they have these this these

492
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
like they have these this these
 

493
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,550
like they have these this these
thoughts. And now we all have random

494
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:50,560
thoughts. And now we all have random
 

495
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,990
thoughts. And now we all have random
thoughts of like, you know, kick that

496
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,000
thoughts of like, you know, kick that
 

497
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,829
thoughts of like, you know, kick that
child. No, I'm joking. But we do

498
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
child. No, I'm joking. But we do
 

499
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:54,790
child. No, I'm joking. But we do
actually have thoughts where it's like,

500
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:54,800
actually have thoughts where it's like,
 

501
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,550
actually have thoughts where it's like,
"Imagine if my phone dropped or imagine

502
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:56,560
"Imagine if my phone dropped or imagine
 

503
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,949
"Imagine if my phone dropped or imagine
if I threw my phone or if I dropped the

504
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
if I threw my phone or if I dropped the
 

505
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,310
if I threw my phone or if I dropped the
baby." Some people have these thoughts.

506
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
baby." Some people have these thoughts.
 

507
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,590
baby." Some people have these thoughts.
It's because it's the brain alerting you

508
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600
It's because it's the brain alerting you
 

509
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,269
It's because it's the brain alerting you
of the danger and you going, "Oh my god,

510
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,279
of the danger and you going, "Oh my god,
 

511
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,550
of the danger and you going, "Oh my god,
why did I think of that?" Cuz it's

512
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:04,560
why did I think of that?" Cuz it's
 

513
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,310
why did I think of that?" Cuz it's
creating a little simulation of this is

514
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
creating a little simulation of this is
 

515
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,990
creating a little simulation of this is
real. This is a threat. This is a

516
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,000
real. This is a threat. This is a
 

517
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,670
real. This is a threat. This is a
possibility that's going to happen. So

518
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:09,680
possibility that's going to happen. So
 

519
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,990
possibility that's going to happen. So
yeah, again, these people, if you've

520
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,000
yeah, again, these people, if you've
 

521
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,590
yeah, again, these people, if you've
seen them, there's a 40% chance that

522
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600
seen them, there's a 40% chance that
 

523
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,750
seen them, there's a 40% chance that
these people sacrifice if they do this

524
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:15,760
these people sacrifice if they do this
 

525
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,310
these people sacrifice if they do this
plus joy. So they're feeling joy and

526
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:18,320
plus joy. So they're feeling joy and
 

527
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,470
plus joy. So they're feeling joy and
they're shocked. And I think this is

528
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
they're shocked. And I think this is
 

529
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,910
they're shocked. And I think this is
what I've added on. the person that was

530
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:21,920
what I've added on. the person that was
 

531
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,590
what I've added on. the person that was
doing this didn't actually say this.

532
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:23,600
doing this didn't actually say this.
 

533
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,990
doing this didn't actually say this.
They're thinking of things and they're

534
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,000
They're thinking of things and they're
 

535
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,190
They're thinking of things and they're
like, "Oh yeah, imagine if I did that."

536
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,200
like, "Oh yeah, imagine if I did that."
 

537
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,069
like, "Oh yeah, imagine if I did that."
And they went, "Oh, imagine if I did do

538
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:29,079
And they went, "Oh, imagine if I did do
 

539
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:32,550
And they went, "Oh, imagine if I did do
that." Again, very scary. And I've seen

540
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
that." Again, very scary. And I've seen
 

541
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,230
that." Again, very scary. And I've seen
a few people that do that on pictures

542
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
a few people that do that on pictures
 

543
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,230
a few people that do that on pictures
and I'm like, "Whoa, red

544
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:37,240
and I'm like, "Whoa, red
 

545
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,590
and I'm like, "Whoa, red
flags." Again, I don't have enough time.

546
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
flags." Again, I don't have enough time.
 

547
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,590
flags." Again, I don't have enough time.
3 minutes. And I feel like because the

3 minutes. And I feel like because the
 

549
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,110
3 minutes. And I feel like because the
time is limiting me, I feel like I don't

550
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
time is limiting me, I feel like I don't

587
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,550
they're all N? Where's her sensor?" So
that is a bit obviously that's not

that is a bit obviously that's not

dog typed you you know I know people
probably appreciate Dave Shan. I get it.

602
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:33,760
probably appreciate Dave Shan. I get it.
 

603
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,750
probably appreciate Dave Shan. I get it.
I get it. I'm not official type

604
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:35,760
I get it. I'm not official type
 

605
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,710
I get it. I'm not official type
obviously. Hence why there's this

606
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:36,720
