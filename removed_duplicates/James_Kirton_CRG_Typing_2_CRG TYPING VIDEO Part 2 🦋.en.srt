1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:04,190

well I cut off sorry part two

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:04,200
well I cut off sorry part two
 

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,769
well I cut off sorry part two
I think I can upload it like this

4
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:06,779
I think I can upload it like this
 

5
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:08,570
I think I can upload it like this
but yeah I think that's just been you

6
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:08,580
but yeah I think that's just been you
 

7
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,430
but yeah I think that's just been you
know getting back on track of like who I

8
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:10,440
know getting back on track of like who I
 

9
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,950
know getting back on track of like who I
was and how determined I was

10
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:12,960
was and how determined I was
 

11
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,230
was and how determined I was
but it's just when you hit a low it's

12
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:15,240
but it's just when you hit a low it's
 

13
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,670
but it's just when you hit a low it's
just you lose everything there's no

14
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:16,680
just you lose everything there's no
 

15
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,210
just you lose everything there's no
point to anything and I I was always

16
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:19,220
point to anything and I I was always
 

17
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,170
point to anything and I I was always
theorizing like you know like usually

18
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:21,180
theorizing like you know like usually
 

19
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,450
theorizing like you know like usually
people shut themselves off you know

20
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:23,460
people shut themselves off you know
 

21
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,029
people shut themselves off you know
become a recluse

22
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:26,039
become a recluse
 

23
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,589
become a recluse
but I was thinking the reason is that is

24
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:27,599
but I was thinking the reason is that is
 

25
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,870
but I was thinking the reason is that is
like the brain's kind of ramping itself

26
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:29,880
like the brain's kind of ramping itself
 

27
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,110
like the brain's kind of ramping itself
up it's preparing itself for after you

28
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,120
up it's preparing itself for after you
 

29
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,850
up it's preparing itself for after you
know it's you know I mean like it's it's

30
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:34,860
know it's you know I mean like it's it's
 

31
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,610
know it's you know I mean like it's it's
fixing whatever problems in front of it

32
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:37,620
fixing whatever problems in front of it
 

33
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,770
fixing whatever problems in front of it
and you know this like the amygdala

34
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:39,780
and you know this like the amygdala
 

35
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,869
and you know this like the amygdala
expands and the hippocampus shrinks you

36
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:41,879
expands and the hippocampus shrinks you
 

37
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:42,770
expands and the hippocampus shrinks you
know

38
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:42,780
know
 

39
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,330
know
because it's just getting ramped up for

40
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:44,340
because it's just getting ramped up for
 

41
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,889
because it's just getting ramped up for
the stress that could be coming

42
00:00:45,889 --> 00:00:45,899
the stress that could be coming
 

43
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,690
the stress that could be coming
to get you prepared you know you can't

44
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:47,700
to get you prepared you know you can't
 

45
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,450
to get you prepared you know you can't
be exchanging information with people or

46
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:50,460
be exchanging information with people or
 

47
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,090
be exchanging information with people or
wasting time on other things and when

48
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:53,100
wasting time on other things and when
 

49
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,010
wasting time on other things and when
there's things that are coming or things

50
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:55,020
there's things that are coming or things
 

51
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,049
there's things that are coming or things
that are currently happening

52
00:00:57,049 --> 00:00:57,059
that are currently happening
 

53
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,869
that are currently happening
so you know and but I think once after

54
00:00:59,869 --> 00:00:59,879
so you know and but I think once after
 

55
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,069
so you know and but I think once after

but yeah I think that
I don't know really it's just so Random

84
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:28,799
I don't know really it's just so Random
 

85
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,170
I don't know really it's just so Random
like I'm not even seeing anything I

86
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:30,180
like I'm not even seeing anything I
 

87
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,210
like I'm not even seeing anything I
don't think I'm saying things I feel as

88
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:32,220
don't think I'm saying things I feel as
 

89
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,249
don't think I'm saying things I feel as
if I'm just like

90
00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:34,259
if I'm just like
 

91
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,109
if I'm just like
it is just uh

92
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:36,119
it is just uh
 

93
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,969
it is just uh
ping has one point and

94
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:40,979

 

95
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,030

you know but um

96
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:44,040
you know but um
 

97
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,450
you know but um
yeah just on a scroll in the mud

98
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:47,460
yeah just on a scroll in the mud
 

99
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,149
yeah just on a scroll in the mud
it's all dry

100
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
it's all dry
 

101
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,770
it's all dry
oh it's gonna be really hot today as

102
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:51,780
oh it's gonna be really hot today as
 

103
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,010
oh it's gonna be really hot today as
well 27 degrees which is if we do the

104
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:55,020
well 27 degrees which is if we do the
 

105
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,810
well 27 degrees which is if we do the
math we do the fahrenheit so you've got

106
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:56,820
math we do the fahrenheit so you've got
 

107
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,929
math we do the fahrenheit so you've got
a plus 32 I don't know why you still use

108
00:01:59,929 --> 00:01:59,939
a plus 32 I don't know why you still use
 

109
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,429
a plus 32 I don't know why you still use
your colonizers

110
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439
your colonizers
 

111
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,249
your colonizers
um measurement as well we've got 32 plus

112
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:04,259
um measurement as well we've got 32 plus
 

113
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,809
um measurement as well we've got 32 plus
27 which equals 59 imagine it's wrong

114
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:08,819
27 which equals 59 imagine it's wrong
 

115
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:11,690
27 which equals 59 imagine it's wrong
it's like Jesus and then you've got a

116
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:11,700
it's like Jesus and then you've got a
 

117
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,449
it's like Jesus and then you've got a
div wait 59 then you've got a I think

118
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:14,459
div wait 59 then you've got a I think
 

119
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,790
div wait 59 then you've got a I think
I'm gonna divide it by nine which would

120
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:16,800
I'm gonna divide it by nine which would
 

121
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,729
I'm gonna divide it by nine which would
be um I don't think I've got ti so bear

122
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:19,739
be um I don't think I've got ti so bear
 

123
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:20,630
be um I don't think I've got ti so bear
with me

124
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,640
with me
 

125
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,750
with me
so 59 wait is it 50 yeah 59 divided by 9

126
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760
so 59 wait is it 50 yeah 59 divided by 9
 

127
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,150
so 59 wait is it 50 yeah 59 divided by 9
which would equal

128
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
which would equal
 

129
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,990
which would equal
five six

130
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,000
five six
 

131
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,210
five six
point oh

132
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:32,220
point oh
 

133
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,910
point oh
six point where where

134
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:34,920
six point where where
 

135
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,530
six point where where
seven

136
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:36,540
seven
 

137
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,089
seven
no yeah I think 6.7 Times by five which

138
00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:41,099
no yeah I think 6.7 Times by five which
 

139
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,070
no yeah I think 6.7 Times by five which
would be

140
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:43,080
would be
 

141
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,589
would be
oh God fatty

142
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
oh God fatty
 

143
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,309
oh God fatty
itching my bum 33.3 degrees that's way

144
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:49,319
itching my bum 33.3 degrees that's way
 

145
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,470
itching my bum 33.3 degrees that's way
off it's not it's not freezing here

146
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:51,480
off it's not it's not freezing here
 

147
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,729
off it's not it's not freezing here
right now

148
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:52,739

wasn't I supposed to times it

152
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:57,180
wasn't I supposed to times it
 

153
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,330
wasn't I supposed to times it
I don't know see this is I feel like
