sounds like control you know EP control
 

227
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,830
sounds like control you know EP control
but I don't think it is it's more or

228
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
but I don't think it is it's more or
 

229
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,849
but I don't think it is it's more or
less like

less like
 

231
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:19,310
less like
we're built for um so like think about

232
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:19,320
we're built for um so like think about
 

233
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,009
we're built for um so like think about
Aegis and EPS or like you know the peas

tightening it naturally and then the EPS
 

241
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,629
tightening it naturally and then the EPS
are just unraveling that and the SI

00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
are just unraveling that and the SI
 

243
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,909
are just unraveling that and the SI
hates that but it allows for new things

it's like that's hoarding it's kind of

642
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:38,820
it's like that's hoarding it's kind of
 

643
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,970
it's like that's hoarding it's kind of
and also I feel like if I drop the bomb

and also I feel like if I drop the bomb
 

645
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,170
and also I feel like if I drop the bomb
into a space essentially I've and not it

646
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:45,180
into a space essentially I've and not it
 

647
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,030
into a space essentially I've and not it

kind of sounds fi like my values are the
worst of course they're not the west but

650
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,440
worst of course they're not the west but
 

651
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,850
worst of course they're not the west but
in my view pretty [\h__\h] up I'm not

657
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,009
but um
you know like placing that there it's

658
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:58,019
you know like placing that there it's
 

659
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,410
you know like placing that there it's
kind of like I assume that no one can

660
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:00,420
kind of like I assume that no one can
 

661
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,790
kind of like I assume that no one can
talk about anything else

662
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:01,800
talk about anything else
 

663
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,449

in the I've now lowered like the economy
 

665
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,730
in the I've now lowered like the economy
think about everything's fine and I've

666
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:07,740
think about everything's fine and I've
 

667
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,930
think about everything's fine and I've
just dropped it and deflated everything

668
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:08,940
just dropped it and deflated everything
 

669
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,329
just dropped it and deflated everything
and now it's like [\h__\h] I can't even

670
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:11,339
and now it's like [\h__\h] I can't even

1899
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,109
externalize our
um a Consciousness I suppose it gets to

1900
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:30,119
um a Consciousness I suppose it gets to
 

1901
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,329
um a Consciousness I suppose it gets to
the point where technology becomes

1902
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:32,339
the point where technology becomes
 

1903
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:34,190
the point where technology becomes
self-systematized

1904
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:34,200
self-systematized
 

1905
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,409
self-systematized
autonomous oh there's other people it's

1906
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:36,419
autonomous oh there's other people it's
 

1907
00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:38,089
autonomous oh there's other people it's
kind of awkward

1908
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:38,099
kind of awkward
 

1909
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:40,010
kind of awkward
yeah

1910
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:40,020
yeah
 

1911
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,169
yeah
it's very awkward

1912
00:34:42,169 --> 00:34:42,179
it's very awkward
 

1913
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,570
it's very awkward
another traps

1914
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:44,580
another traps
 

1915
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,970
another traps
the under inside

1916
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:46,980
the under inside
 

1917
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,829
the under inside
you think

1918
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:48,839
you think
 

1919
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:53,810
you think
I don't know

1920
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:53,820

 

1921
00:34:53,820 --> 00:35:00,349

acquired

1922
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:00,359

 

1923
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:01,970

right um

1924
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:01,980
right um
 

1925
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,210
right um
yeah they're saying like

1926
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:05,220

 

1927
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,829

as I was saying

1928
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:06,839
as I was saying
 

1929
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:08,089
as I was saying
is that

1930
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:08,099
is that
 

1931
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:10,310
is that
that you know you get to that point

1932
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:10,320
that you know you get to that point
 

1933
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,470
that you know you get to that point
but it's like are we seriously doing the

1934
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:12,480
but it's like are we seriously doing the
 

1935
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,849
but it's like are we seriously doing the
right thing

1936
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:13,859
right thing
 

1937
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:15,589
right thing
are we

1938
00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:15,599
are we
 

1939
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,230
are we
on the right course you know

1940
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:18,240
on the right course you know
 

1941
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,290
on the right course you know
it's squeezing this like like depression

1942
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:21,300
it's squeezing this like like depression
 

1943
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,030
it's squeezing this like like depression
obviously you gotta have depression

1944
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,040
obviously you gotta have depression
 

1945
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,770
obviously you gotta have depression
another thing I've noticed is like I

1946
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:24,780
another thing I've noticed is like I
 

1947
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,109
another thing I've noticed is like I
think we've do my fi if I do have fi

1948
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:27,119
think we've do my fi if I do have fi
 

1949
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,550
think we've do my fi if I do have fi
right at the bottom

1950
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:28,560
right at the bottom
 

1951
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,430
right at the bottom
is that it's essentially a

1952
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:31,440
is that it's essentially a
 

1953
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,770
is that it's essentially a
um like a tally chart and oh yeah better

1954
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:33,780
um like a tally chart and oh yeah better
 

1955
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,630
um like a tally chart and oh yeah better
than before that's like I don't know if

1956
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:35,640
than before that's like I don't know if
 

1957
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,829
than before that's like I don't know if
that's an Enneagram three thing I don't

1958
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:36,839
that's an Enneagram three thing I don't
 

1959
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:38,089
that's an Enneagram three thing I don't
know

1960
00:35:38,089 --> 00:35:38,099
know
 

1961
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:41,030
know
but um it's like I thought it was stable

1962
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,040
but um it's like I thought it was stable
 

1963
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,730
but um it's like I thought it was stable
it was just I felt nothingness okay I

1964
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:43,740
it was just I felt nothingness okay I
 

1965
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,349
it was just I felt nothingness okay I
just I wasn't even in touch with what I

1966
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:45,359
just I wasn't even in touch with what I
 

1967
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,870
just I wasn't even in touch with what I
was feeling and it was just random

1968
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:47,880
was feeling and it was just random
 

1969
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,910
was feeling and it was just random
spikes down spikes up franticular

1970
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:51,920
spikes down spikes up franticular
 

1971
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,650
spikes down spikes up franticular
unpredictable and it would just be a

1972
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:54,660
unpredictable and it would just be a

subjective thing it can be anything

2010
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:38,520
subjective thing it can be anything
 

2011
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,390
subjective thing it can be anything
