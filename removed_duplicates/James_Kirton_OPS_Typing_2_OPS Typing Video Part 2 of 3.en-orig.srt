very small numbers in the 70s it kicked

294
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
very small numbers in the 70s it kicked
 

295
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,189
very small numbers in the 70s it kicked
off whereas in tens of thousands now it

296
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:16,199
off whereas in tens of thousands now it
 

297
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,350
off whereas in tens of thousands now it
was 1.3 million last year the year

298
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:18,360
was 1.3 million last year the year
 

299
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,309
was 1.3 million last year the year
before that's 600,000 so we're wrapping

300
00:05:20,309 --> 00:05:20,319
before that's 600,000 so we're wrapping
 

301
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,230
before that's 600,000 so we're wrapping
things up um yeah so that's why we have

302
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:25,240
things up um yeah so that's why we have
 

303
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,749
things up um yeah so that's why we have
that is that is why they're wrong

304
00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:26,759
that is that is why they're wrong
 

305
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,390
that is that is why they're wrong
because obviously if you think there's

306
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
because obviously if you think there's
 

307
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,270
because obviously if you think there's
some institutionalized thing

308
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:30,280
some institutionalized thing
 

309
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,710
some institutionalized thing
how can it just it's because in 50 years

310
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720
