## <× **CORE ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES**

### 1. Row-Centric Design
- **Primary Key**: Every operation uses `row_id` as the universal identifier
- **Context Preservation**: `RowContext` objects travel with every download to maintain relationships
- **Type Safety**: Critical personality type data (e.g., "FF-Fi/Se-CP/B(S) #4") is preserved throughout all operations

### 2. Atomic Operations
- **File Locking**: All CSV updates use file locking to prevent corruption during concurrent access
- **Transaction Safety**: Each download updates CSV atomically with complete error tracking
- **State Consistency**: System maintains consistent state even during interruptions

### 3. Bidirectional Mapping
- **File ’ Row**: Metadata files embedded in downloads enable reverse lookup
- **Row ’ File**: CSV tracks all downloaded files with media IDs for forward lookup
- **Complete Traceability**: Every file can be traced back to its source CSV row and personality type

### 4. Direct S3 Streaming
- **No Local Storage**: Files stream directly from source to S3 without touching disk
- **UUID Organization**: Files stored with unique identifiers for scalable organization
- **Virus Scan Handling**: Large Google Drive files automatically bypass scan warnings
